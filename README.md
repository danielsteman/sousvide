# sousvide
A script for ESP8266 to read water temperatures and control a relay. Set a temperature and oscillate around it by switching the relay on- and off. In my application, I placed the relay in between a rice cooker and its power cable and placed the temperature sensor in the water reservoir to mimic a [sous vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous_vide) device.
